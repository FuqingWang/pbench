* Version 0.51

** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the
[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install or update.

After installation or update, you should have version 0.51-1g8d37ba0
of the pbench-agent RPM installed.

** agent

~pbench-{move,copy}-results~ has acquired a ~--user~ option. If you
say "pbench-move-results --user=ndk", then the results will be
available under a new hierarchy on the server:

http://pbench.example.com/users/ndk/<controller>

as well as under the existing results/hierarchy:

http://pbench.example.com/results/<controller>

The ~--prefix~ option is still available and will change the hierarchy
after the <controller> part, e.g. ~pbench-move-results --user=ndk --prefix=foo/bar~
will create entries for the current set of results under 

http://pbench.example.com/users/ndk/<controller>/foo/bar

and also under

http://pbench.example.com/results/<controller>/foo/bar

The ~--user~ and ~--prefix~ options are handled differently now: they are
part of the metadata for the run and get indexed into ES along with
the rest of the metadata. As a result, they are an immutable part of
the run: there is no way to edit them currently, although this is subject
to change. In particular, the ~pbench-edit-prefix~ script will not work as
it stands.

An alternative way to tag the results with a user is to set the environment
variable PBENCH_USER and export it. If you are driving pbench through your
own script, then adding
#+begin_src shell
  export PBENCH_USER=ndk
#+end_src
might be more convenient than modifying the invocation(s) of
~pbench-{move,copy}-results~.


*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

See the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issues on Github]].

*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- ~pbench-move-results~ was reworked to decouple it as much as possible
from the server implementation. As a result, the number of ssh calls
it makes to the server was reduced substantially.

- ~pbench-trafficgen~ got a large number of updates, including
a new traffic generator, ~trex-txrx-profile~.

** server

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities


*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- The scripts that back up tarballs and verify their integrity
were reworked after the server migration that we went through,
to make them more robust and to detect problems as early as
possible.

- status reporting by the server scripts (which now goes to ES
as part of the mail flood mitigation mentioned in the v0.50 release
notes) is improved to make the status more readable.

** web-server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: web-server-0.51
:END:

A new build of the pbench web server has been made, although it does
not include any changes from before. The version is 0.51-1g8d37ba0.

* Version 0.50

** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the
[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install or update.

After installation or update, you should have version 0.50-1g799ea02
of the pbench-agent RPM installed.

** agent

Fedora 28 has been added to the build list on COPR and agent RPMs
for it have been produced. However, we have not produced RPMs for
the benchmarks and tools that pbench provides. That will be done
shortly and a separate announcement will be sent out.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

See the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issues on Github]].

*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- Openvswitch tool has been added.

- External data source tool has been added. This allows an external
  data source that is gathering data during the run to be specified
  and added to the metadata for the run. See issue #379 and PR #796
  (https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/external-data-source).

- pbench-sysinfo-dump gathers Spectre/Meltdown data if available.

** server

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities


*** Bug fixes and enhancements
- Pidstat data are now indexed into Elasticsearch.

- In response to an IT request, we are implementing changes to cut
  down on the volume of email that the cron jobs produce.  This
  release includes changes to the server scripts that index
  status/error reports from the scripts into ElasticSearch, instead of
  sending mail. There are other mitigation strategies being pursued
  but they are outside the scope of pbench, so they are not described
  here.

* Version 0.49

** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the
[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install or update.

After installation or update, you should have version 0.49-1g6b67ec6
of the pbench-agent RPM installed.

** agent

We rebuilt pbench-sysstat and benchmark RPMs to include Fedora 27.  We
can no longer build for Fedora 25 or earlier on COPR, so those
platforms are not supported any longer.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

See the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issues on Github]] for an (extensive) list.

*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- New benchmark: pbench-trafficgen.
- The pbench-fio RPM is now based on upstream fio 3.3.
- We moved some default settings from the pbench-fio script
  to the config file, in order to make testing easier.
- The config file has been split into an environment-specific
  and a generic piece, very much like the split that was done
  on the server. This change should be invisible to the end-user,
  but if you encounter problems during installation/initial setup,
  please let us know asap.

** server

This is still TBD: For the next release (scheduled for mid April), we
hope to finish the sar indexing work.  The rest of the tool results
will follow.

The inotify implementation has been committed but it is not activated
yet, because of backward-compatibility concerns. We need to
reimplement pbench-move-results on the agent side before we activate
inotify. That will be done in v0.50.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

None known.

*** Bug fixes and enhancements
- Various small fixes plus better logging in some cases.

** web-server

can no longer build for Fedora 25 or earlier on COPR, so those
platforms are not supported any longer.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

pbench-fio has had a bunch of fixes in this release but problems
remain: see the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issues on Github]] for an (extensive) list.

*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- The pbench-fio RPM is now based on upstream fio 3.3.
- We are moving some default setting from the pbench-fio script
  to the config file, in order to make testing easier.
- The config file has been split into an environment-specific
  and a generic piece, very much like the split that was done
  on the server. This change should be invisible to the end-user,
  but if you encounter problems during installation/initial setup,
  please let us know asap.

** server

The indexing script now indexes fio, uperf and moongen results,
including the time series data. It also has undergone some fixes
to deal with different hostname conventions (public vs private
names). It currently indexes iostat and prometheus-metrics data.

For the next release (scheduled for the end of February), we hope to
finish the sar indexing work.  The rest of the tool results will
follow.

The inotify implementation is proceeding but did not make it
for this release. We had a couple of false starts, but we now
think that we have a reasonable implementation and a good chance
that it will land in time for the next release.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

None known

*** Bug fixes and enhancements

- The long-standing pbench-move-unpacked problem (in some cases,
  the incoming directory existed and the script failed to get all
  the required links right) has been fixed.

- In the process of fixing the above, a bug was introduced that caused
  a spurious link to be added to the directory of a run: the link pointed
  to the directory itself with confusing results. This has been fixed
  as well.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities



The pprof tools is undergoing some renovation right now: see issue #675



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



- Running xz in multithread mode in =pbench-move/copy-results= is a

  definite win in most cases, but there was one case reported where it

  segfaulted; running it single-threaded took longer but succeeded. In

  order to allow this fallback, a new option was added to

  =pbench-move/copy-results=: =--xz-single-threaded=.



** server



*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities



- pbench-move-unpacked occasionally leaves a dangling symlink in the

  results/ URL for reasons that we do not quite understand yet. If you

  notice missing results, this is probably the reason. These failures

  were captured in the error log, but not sent as errors in the mail

  sent to the mailing list, so the failures were somewhat hidden. We

  have been monitoring the error log regularly however and fixing such

  failures in fairly short order.



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



- Made the above failure in pbench-move-unpacked visible in the email

  sent to the mailing list, with additional debugging information to

  help us diagnose the error once and for alland fix it (we hope in v0.48).

** server



*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities



The script that copies the contents of each tarball to the distributed

file system uses a job queue implementation to do multiple copies in

parallel. Occasionally, the job queue system gets stuck and it needs a

kick. Fortunately, this is not user-visible, as long as the local

storage can accommodate the backlog. We are hoping to resolve this

problem in v0.47.



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



Most of the changes in this release are to fix some problems in the

handling of satellite servers. There were fairly massive changes

implemented in v0.45, but inevitably there were problems (and there

probably are more).



Almost all of the scripts are running from cron at a 1-minute

interval. In most cases, the script is able to finish all the work

during that one minute. There are two exceptions: moving the tarball

contents from local storage to a DFS backend can take a long time

potentially, but that latency is hidden from the user; data collected

at a satellite server and synced to a master server are deleted once

an hour.



These updates have been pushed to the production server and the

satellite servers. If you see problems, please open an issue.

*** Known problems and backward incompatibilities

Some of these were in v0.44 - they are repeated here for convenience.



- =pbench-user-benchmark= will now produce a warning about a

  non-existent JSON result file (see v0.44 release notes). We have a

  work item to fix this in v0.46.



- =pbench-fio= issues multiple warnings after postprocessing the

  latency log files. We thought that this was caused by the last two

  lines in two of these files having the same timestamp, but there may

  be duplicate timestamps in other places as well. This is

  probably a fio bug.



- (not fixed in v0.44) The Python Pandas package goes by different

  names on RHEL and Fedora.  The current code uses "python-pandas"

  which works for RHEL, but not for Fedora.  The workaround for Fedora

  is to actually change the =pbench-fio= script to install

  "python2-pandas". This has been fixed in v0.45.



- Two new dependencies have been added to =pbench-agent=: =perl-JSON=

  and =perl-Switch=. These are used to produce JSON files for the

  results of benchmarks (currently, =pbench-uperf=, =pbench-moongen=

  and =pbench-fio= produce such JSON files). =perl-JSON= is available

  from the standard RHEL and Fedora repos, but =perl-Switch= is only

  available from the standard Fedora repos; on RHEL, you will need to

  add the RHEL "optional packages" repo. This can be done by copying



https://github.com/redhat-performance/perf-dept/blob/master/repo_files/rhel7-latest.repo



to =/etc/yum.repos.d=.



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



- Some benchmark scripts now take an additional option:

  --sysinfo=<val> where <val> can be "default", "all", "none", or a

  comma-separated list of words from the following list:

  kernel_config, block, libvirt, sos, block, topology, ara.  The <val>

  is passed through to pbench-collect-sysinfo, to allow the the user

  to tailor what kind of system information will be collected (if

  any). E.g.



pbench-fio --sysinfo=none <other args>



will not collect *any* system information.



pbench-user-benchmark, pbench-fio, pbench-uperf and pbench-moongen

have been modified to accept the new option. We did not get to the

rest of the benchmarks in v0.45, but if you need a benchmark

modified along these lines asap, please open an issue and mark it

"v0.46".



Unfortunately, there was a bug that caused the script to *not*

collect any sosreport (and most other) data in the default

configuration. This has been fixed in v0.45.



- The prometheus tool now accepts some additional options: a port

  number can be specified instead of the default, as well as

  non-default certs. It also sets GOPATH properly. Note that the

  prom2json tool that is used underneath the covers has undergone

  some changes that broke functionality. Fixes were submitted upstream

  and have been merged, so things work properly now.



Various bugs have been addressed in v0.45 and the tool has

seen some enhancements.



- The openvswitch tool has undergone many fixes and enhancements.



- A bug in the pbench-user-tool script has been fixed.



** server



The server code underwent fairly radical changes:



- There is a new dispatch script that handles incoming tarballs, checks

  MD5s and dispatches to the appropriate set of scripts (depending

  on the server).

- Tarballs are unpacked locally and are *not* copied to the distributed

  file system backend synchronously. Instead, the data can be viewed from

  this temporary location. This should alleviate the latency problem that

  we have been suffering from.

- A new script copies the unpacked data to the backend asynchronously

  and then patches up the links to allow data viewing from the "permanent"

  location.

- The satellite-server-to-production-server sync mechanism has been

  revamped to allow much more frequent syncing. Unfortunately, there

  are some problems that we hope to resolve imminently.



The new server bits have been deployed on the production server. They are

going to be deployed on the satellite servers in the next day or two.



** web-server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: web-server-0.45
:END:

A fix to speed up loading of pidstat data was added to jschart.js

(issue #608 describes the problem in detail).



If you do decide to update, the instructions are standard:

#+begin_example

  dnf clean expire-cache

  dnf update pbench-web-server
#+end_example

(or the yum equivalents.)  The current version available from COPR

is 0.45-1g8874a17.

*** Bug fixes and enhancements



- (v0.43) pbench-user-benchmark also produces a rudimentary JSON result

  file (it only includes a duration for the run), but there are

  provisions to allow the user benchmark to produce a JSON file

  which pbench-user-benchmark will upload for indexing.



- (v0.43 with updates) Some benchmark scripts now take an additional

  option: --sysinfo=<val> where <val> can be "default", "all", "none",

have been modified to accept the new option. We may (or may not)

get to the rest of the benchmarks in v0.45, but if you need a

benchmark modified along these lines asap, please open an issue

and mark it "v0.45".

and associated PR:



https://github.com/prometheus/prom2json/pull/22



If you find any problems, please open an issue, but as far as

we know, there should not be any.



- Various tools added to the default configuration for openshift.



- A bug in BenchPostprocess::get_uid has been fixed: it was fixed

  previously, but the fix got lost somehow. It is now fixed again,

  hopefully for good.

https://github.com/redhat-performance/perf-dept/blob/master/repo_files/rhel7-latest.repo



to =/etc/yum.repos.d=.

- Note that the output of the benchmarks that have been converted to

  produce JSON files is now stored in files named

  =result.{txt,csv,json,html}=. The information in these files should

  be the same as in the older =summary-result.{txt,csv,html}=, although

  the format may be different.



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



- pbench-fio produces JSON results now, using the same libraries

  that were used in pbench-uperf and pbench-moongen.



- pbench-user-benchmark also produces a rudimentary JSON result

  file (it only includes a duration for the run), but there are

  provisions to allow the user benchmark to produce a JSON file

  which pbench-user-benchmark will upload for indexing.



- Benchmark directory names contain a time stamp, which previously

  contained colons. This caused difficulties with docker, so the

  timestamp format has been changed to contain only periods. Internal

  timestamps (e.g. in the metadata.log) are still in the original format

  using colons; there is no plan to change those.



- Some benchmark scripts now take an additional option: --sysinfo=<val>

  where <val> can be "default", "all", "none", or a comma-separated

  list of words from the following list: kernel_config, block,

  libvirt, sos, block, topology, ara.  The <val> is passed through to

  pbench-collect-sysinfo, to allow the the user to tailor what kind of

  system information will be collected (if any). E.g.



pbench-fio --sysinfo=none <other args>



will not collect *any* system information.



Although this was meant to be applied generally, currently only

pbench-user-benchmark has been converted. There are outstanding

PRs for pbench-fio, pbench-uperf and uperf-moongen to be modified

the same way - they will be available in v0.44. The rest of the

benchmark scripts will then follow (probably in v0.45, although

depending on demand, we may convert some of them earlier).



- A "disk" tool has been added: it runs "df" periodically, collects

  the results and post-processes them to render various graphs.



- There will be a number of documentation changes that will be

  rolled out in the next couple of weeks, out-of-band with the

  releases. Notification will be sent out about those changes

  as they happen.



** server



The script that syncs "satellite" pbench servers to a master server

has been sped up to allow more frequent invocation from cron. However,

the rsyncing itself and (particularly) the unpacking of the synced

tarballs on the master server is still a bottleneck. We have a work

item to improve that in v0.44.



The indexing script continues to be enahnced: it now indexes iostat

tool data, and more information has been added to the metadata:

iterations and samples are now indexed. We are planning to deploy test

versions of the indexer in the next month that will index results and

more tool data (to the staging ES instance), then roll it into the

production server in the v0.44 release.  It is likely however that

we'll iterate a number of times on the indexer in the next few

months.

plan to work on this in the next week or two. We'll send out details

when it's ready.

Various fixes to the recently added latency histogram functionality.

Improve the graph descriptions by adding units to them. This is

probably just a stopgap first step: there are plans to make various

graph characteristics specified easily and in some cases customizable

* Version 0.40



** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the

[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install.



After installation or update, you should have version 0.40-1gf281562

of the pbench-agent RPM installed.



** agent



*** Backward incompatibilities

None known.



*** Bug fixes and enhancements



User-visible changes include:



**** =pbench-fio=

The pbench-fio script has undergone significant enhancements in order

to take advantage of several facilities implemented in the upstream fio

project. In particular, it gathers and reports latency histograms as

implemented by Karl Cronburg.



*N.B.* The script that processes the logs to get the histograms uses the

Python Pandas library. This script only runs on the controller, so the

library has to be installed there. =pbench-fio= tries to install the library

and it should succeed e.g. on Fedora systems. On RHEL systems however, the

=python-pandas= library is available from EPEL, but not from the standard

installation repos. You will therefore need to install the EPEL repo before

running =pbench-fio= on your controller. Details on EPEL can be found [[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][here]].



The process is as follows: on your RHEL7 controller (and similarly for RHEL6)

#+begin_example

  cd /tmp

  curl --output ./epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm  https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

  yum install ./epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
#+end_example

After that, the =pbench-fio= script should be able to find and install

the =python-pandas= package.



*N.B.* You need the 2.14-9 (or later) version of the pbench-fio RPM,

which is available from the COPR pbench repo. This RPM is based on current

upstream fio master. The =pbench-fio= script will check for and install

this version, but please bear the dependency in mind if something goes

wrong.



You can now explicitly pass a fio job file to the script, instead of

or in addition to specifying fio options on the command line. We generally

recommend using the command line options for simple usage where that suffices,

but if you need options that =pbench-fio= does not implement, then using

a job file will be necessary.



You can run fio on a set of clients either by using the --clients=... option

to =pbench-fio=, explicitly listing the set of clients; or you can use the

--client-file=... option to pass a file containing the list of clients, one

client per line.



**** =pbench-moongen=

New options.



**** pbench-user-benchmark

The variable specifying the run directory, =benchmark_run_dir=, is now

exported by the main script, making it available to the user-provided

benchmark script (e.g. for squirreling away stuff to package up with the

rest of the data for storage/processing on the server).



This is only one part of a larger [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues/349][issue #349]].



**** Triggers

Trigger functionality has been restored.



**** Hardening of tools-<group> directory handling

In some cases, additional files or subdirectories in the tools-default (or

more generally, tools-<group>) directory have caused problems. We now skip

subdirectories and check files against the available tools list, skipping

any that don't match. A warning is issued in either case suggesting that

the suspect file/subdirectory be removed.



**** Fixes to graph rendering

See [[#web-server-0.40][web-server]] below.



** server



- Add mail notifications to the scripts that backs up results tarballs

  for safekeeping.



- Add verification script to detect bit-rot in tarballs.



- We now run a cron job to fetch tarballs from "satellite" servers and

  store them on our "production" server. The intent is to relieve some

  of the disk space pressure on the satellite, and to take advantage

  of the backup and bit-rot detection facilities that we employ on the

  production server.



- An additional script to age out results on a satellite server is in

  the works but is not running yet.



** web-server
:PROPERTIES:

The pbench-web-server RPM has been updated with many fixes, cleanups

and optimizations. The major user-visible change is better handling

of outliers - see [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues/317][issue #317]].



If you have it installed, you probably want to update:

#+end_example

(or the yum equivalents.)  The current version available from COPR

* Version 0.39



** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the

[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install.



After installation or update, you should have version 0.39-3g4f9ab11

of the pbench-agent RPM installed.



** agent

*** Backward incompatibilities

**** pbench-agent config file renamed

All configuration files now have a suffix of ".cfg", rather than

".conf".  In particular, the default pbench-agent config file is now

~/opt/pbench-agent/config/pbench-agent.cfg~.  You might have to rename

your existing config file:

#+begin_example

  cd /opt/pbench-agent/config

  mv pbench-agent.conf pbench-agent.cfg
#+end_example

If you have problems (e.g. =pbench-register-tool-set= only registers the ~perf~

tool, rather than a complete set; =pbench-move-results= fails because it cannot

find a server), check with:

#+begin_example

  cat $CONFIG
#+end_example

If that fails, then pbench cannot find the config file, most probably because

of the renaming described above.

**** pbench-netperf script has bit-rotted

The pbench-netperf script seems to have bit-rotted. We are trying to

decide whether to fix it or abandon it. If you have an opinion, please

comment at https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues/291.



*** New features

Please submit suggestions/issues to the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issue tracker]].



**** JSON files for pbench-uperf

The postprocessing now produces JSON files that we are planning to use

in order to index benchmark results and tool output into ES. The

backend work necessary to index these results will be done between

v0.39 and v0.40 and might necessitate changes to the JSON output. So

pbench-uperf is treated as a guinea pig and once the output format

solidifies, the rest of the benchmarks are going to be converted as

well, probably starting with pbench-fio.



A large part of the work for pbench-uperf has been to refactor the

pbench-uperf script, so that the resulting pieces can be

reused. Andrew hopes to have 90% of each benchmark script code in

reusable packages, which will also simplify adding new scripts in the

future.



**** The pbench docs on github have been revamped

The docs can now be processed in two ways: to produce "internal"

documents, including the more automated installation that is possible

internally, as well as "external" documents that are more generic and

depend only on externally available resources.



The docs on github have been replaced by the "external" documents:

there are still some ~example.com~ fake URLs (clearly marked, we hope)

but almost all URLs now point to their correct referent and the instructions

should be enough to get pbench-agent/pbench-server/pbench-web-server installed

in an arbitrary environment, but with some manual work required (again, clearly

described, we hope, even if it is somewhat laborious).



*** Bug fixes



**** Better error handling by utility scripts

In particular, errors in ssh invocations in pipelines are caught and returned

properly. More work is planned in this area for upcoming releases, in particular

hardening the benchmark scripts so that they deal better with errors and signals.



**** Safer killing of tools

A safer kill has been implemented for all the tools that are linked to

=kvm-spinlock=.  Assuming no problems surface, the sar-based tools

will get the same treatment in upcoming releases.



**** Screen session names were too long

The screen command fails when the name of the screen session (-S) is

very long. This happens when the iteration full name is quite long. A

fix for this uses only the iteration number, reducing the screen

name to a safe length.

**** Fixes to graph rendering

See [[#web-server-0.39][web-server]] below.


** server

Server installation was simplified in v0.38: there is an RPM on COPR that can be used

for installation, but as for the pbench-agent, it is not completely self-contained: one

needs to install various configuration files and generate a directory structure for apache,

a directory structure for results and a crontab that invokes the various scripts to process

incoming results and make them available for viewing on the web.



This release adds scripts to do these tasks somewhat more conveniently. It is possible to

use these scripts from an RPM that installs the config files and then invokes the scripts to

finish the installation. But it is also possible to do these steps manually. See the

[[file:~/src/internal/pbench/doc/server/installation.org][server installation guide]] for details.



** web-server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: web-server-0.39

* Version 0.38



** Installation                                                    :external:

There are no installation changes in this release: see the

[[file:../agent/installation.org][Installation Instructions]] for how to install.



After installation or update, you should have version 0.38-1g0db11ba

of the pbench-agent RPM installed.



** agent

*** Backward incompatibilities

In the v0.36 timeframe, all pbench scripts and benchmarks that are

normally accessible were renamed: those that did not have a prefix at

all were renamed with a "pbench-" prefix; the benchmarks had a

"pbench_" prefix and were renamed for consistency with a "pbench-"

prefix as well.



In v0.37, there were compatibility links to the old names in util-scripts.



In v0.38, these links have been deleted: you will have to make sure

that you use (and all your scripts use) the names with the "pbench-"

prefix.



*** New features

Please submit suggestions/issues to the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/issues][issue tracker]].



**** New graphs



The major change in this release is the replacement of the original

nvd3 graphs with graphs produced by a library written by Karl Rister.

The advantage of this library is that it is much less demanding on

the browser than the original graph library.



Note that it uses the same CSV files that the original graphs used,

which it downloads from the server[fn:1]: big data sets are still

going to incur long time penalties for the transfer. The difference is

that once the download is complete, your browser will stand a much

better chance of staying alive and able to display the graphs.

[fn:1] Unless you install locally - see [[http://pbench.example.com/server/pbench-web-server.html][PBench web server]] for instructions.



*** Bug fixes



**** Fixed the RPM names for tools and benchmarks to include the pbench- prefix

PBench will now be able to find and install the correct RPMs (with the

current exception of pbench-iperf as noted above).



**** Fixed the URL for the COPR repo

The documentation on GitHub was pointing to a non-existent place for

the COPR pbench-agent RPM: it used a sanitized =example.com=

address. This was fixed, but note that the documentation still

contains dead links and will undergo a significant overhaul for

the next release.



**** The pbench-kiil-tools symlink in the repo was wrong.

That was fixed, but the bug did not and does not have any effect on a

local installation: those symlinks are created on the fly by an RPM

%post action.



**** The sar script was modified to handle user-defined options.

Note however that if you use non-standard options, the postprocessing

step for the sar tool (and its relatives) will be skipped, since

pbench does not know how to handle the modified output.





** server                                                          :external:

The server has now been organized in the same way as the agent: there

is an external RPM available from COPR that includes all the scripts,

and some configuration scripts that can be used to install the config

file and perform the rest of the server configuration. See the [[file:../server/installation.org][server

installation guide]].



** web-server



There is an RPM available on COPR that allows local viewing of graphs,

both in the v0.2 format (Andrew's graphs using nvd3) or in the v0.3

format (Karl's graphs using d3). This now includes Karl's latest fixes.

If you have installed an older version, please upgrade. The current version

on COPR is 0.3-10.



** Fedora 24 RPMs on COPR



Fedora 24 has been added to the build list and Fedora 21 has been

deleted from it, for all the RPMS (benchmarks, tools,

pbench-agent, pbench-server, pbench-web-server, configtools).



One benchmark RPM (=pbench-iperf=) is currently failing to build. This

will be fixed shortly.
